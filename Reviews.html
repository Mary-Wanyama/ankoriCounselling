    <h2>ReGain Reviews</h2>
    <p>These quotes represent a few of the many positive reviews that we have received for therapists who work with ReGain. We donâ€™t pay anyone to provide their review and they are all made voluntarily. Some people's experience receiving therapy 
        with ReGain might be different. If 
        you would like to review your therapist, please 
        send your review to contact@regain.us.</p>
